# VioletaBFT

VioletaBFT (Spanish: Colour, Name (F); popular figures: First Female Presidentof Nicaragua and Central America.) is an semi-deterministic (non-interactable oracle) turing machine for prolog-esque byzantine fault tolerant consensus during network partitions, blackouts, and unexplained phenomena. VioletaBFT creates a gossipy mechanism wherein nodes take advantage of some incentive seed; embedded on the homomorphic merkle stree structure of SPHINCS-gravity (digital signature, Anti-Grover Anti-Quantum Computer hacker) establishing a semi-classical raft-esque sentinel architecture comprised of the dirichlet simplex of all possible cluster configurations (kubernetes pods running everything from a blockchain ledger, to a financial trading chunk or a video streaming compression protocol similar to erlang) deploying tasks such as Automatautomated collation and sharding underneath lock-free crossbeam without garbage collector, opting instead to telegraph shared spaces inside the stack, and the location of information on the heap. VioletaBFT introduces a JIT NVMdaemon (memory-sharing multi-tenancy suffix-trees of cracked supercolumnar causet stores.  bstraction, monadic translation, and API implementaion: A multi-layered LLVM Non-Volatile In-Memory Adaptive Badger protocol. VioletaBFT is inspired by merkle tree structures, And-Or Trees, and Relativistic Red-Black Trees. Moreover, VioletaBFT remains O(1) space complexity which makes MX communication easier on the compiler. 

The ability to construct a monadic interpretation of VioletaBFT requires understanding of Dessin graphs: VioletaBFT is a local Line Graph with raft-like properties; aptly labeled 'relativistic side-car' in the spirit of lua. On the other hand, VioletaBFT is a naive PBFT implementation with some elements of Lamport's part time parliament, but under the scheme of schemaless, often aliasable, dirty tables (we use rustqlite to build a lightcone: a closed loop found between three EinsteinDB replicas: MilevaDB and FIDel for federated interactive oracle interfaces and policy distribution per golang's mid 2020 RCP).

EinsteinDB's Haskell-to-Rust replicated-log PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant) mechanism establishes classicla message-passing resource polymorphism with naked singularities. Lemmas can beb constructed on the Lightcone, all current activity between hundreds of isolated independent replicas is packed into a parity-filter with grammar; Every expression received by EinsteinDB is automatically kept as a symbolic epoch or quiescent-column (technically) -- some elements do not exist on the heap with regards to Supercow; Haskell is purely imperative, experiencing a suspension of semaphores by are only tracked via Mileva's append-only lightcone-timeline (optimistic timestamp) byte address; the interfaces exposed via golang's novel generics implementaiton of goyacc provides for a polymorphic knowledge store of triple stores we call causets for Sorkin's three axioms which we have proved with the help of Stable Homotopy Theory, Directed Homotopy, Persistent Homology, and the Coset Poset of Algebraic lore and rigor.

 VioletaBFT represents A mission critical, concurrent programing model in which readers can safely access shared data in simultaneity with active writes. VioletaBFT statically prevents rule violations that other implementation (vanilla raft,  vanilla rcu, ) of lock-free structures do not. VioletaBFT operates a variant of quiescent-based reclamation or QSBR for short. It identifies a quiescent state in each thread as a critical code section that cannot be overwritten while being read by another consumer, but with VioletaBFT, we expand the notion of timelines to three distinct phases of database object mapping: Future, Present, and Past-like datum; all acquiring a fragment of Non-Volatile Memory as a column representing a global (tempid/lookup ref)value which doesn't persist until a grace period has completed.

 VioletaBFT supports partial rollbacks, flexible buffer management, purely asynchronous leader-election and low latency liveness guarantees with minkowski clock skew diffeomorphism for both causal and strong (external) consistency (in combination with FIDel).
